# thyroid-detection
Developing and end to end pipe line implementation for Thyroid Disease Detection 
The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having compensated hypothyroid, primary hypothyroid, secondary hypothyroid or negative (no thyroid) with the help of Machine Learning. 
Classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and KNN Model will train on the thyroid dataset, UCI Machine Learning repository. After we will apply hyperparameter tuning on KNN model  and verify the 
model performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score. Finally Application 
will deploy on any one of the cloud platform with the help of flask framework.
